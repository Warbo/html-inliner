# HTML Inliner #

This script reads HTML data from stdin and writes it to stdout.

It looks for `script` elements with a `src` attribute; and `link` elements with
`type="text/css"`, `rel="stylesheet"` and a `href` attribute.

The `src` and `href` URLs are resolved (relative to `BASE_URL` env var, if
given), and their contents fetched. This content is encoded as Base64 and put in
a data URI in place of the original URL.

Areas for improvement:

 - URL handling/resolving
 - Better MIME handling (we assume all scripts are `text/javascript` and all CSS
   is `text/css`)
 - Support for inlining `img` elements.
